Deakin SIT374/SIT764 - RedBack operation

# redback_mobile_app

A new Flutter project for Redback Operations.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
- [10 Part Flutter course by Angela YU and London App Brewery](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/flutter-part-01-introduction?trk=learning-topics_learning-search-card_search-card&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning)
- [Learning Google Flutter for Mobile Developers by Emmanuel Henri](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-google-flutter-for-mobile-developers?trk=learning-course_related-content-card&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Setting Up Flutter

This [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-flutter-on-windows/) tutorial shows how to install Flutter from the official website and set it up on Android Studio
For a more follow along approach to installing Flutter you can refer this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkUj76YSMhQ&list=PLMQAFLQy-nKfhqpyh5bNvrt_R23U9LMvx&index=3)

If you are going to use Visual Studio Code for development then the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBgCgHBMR3c) will help you set it up for development

## Useful Flutter Commands

`flutter doctor` - checks if all requirements are met to run Flutter
`flutter run` - starts the app. Run with --debug flag to optionally run in DEBUG configuration
`flutter pub get` - this runs automatically when opening the project but is used download any packages specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file
`flutter build [platform]` - builds the application for the desired platform (ios for iOS, apk for Android, web for Web)
`flutter build [platform] --no-sound-null-safety` same as the above but allows the app to be compiled while using libraries which don't support to flutter null safety

## Testing on Device

Testing on device is always the preferred method of testing changes as the emulators cannot always guarantee that what you see is what you get
In addition, physical devices offer access to components such as cameras, microphones or onboard sensor data which cannot replicated as easily in an emulator

### Getting started on Android

1. In your terminal, run `flutter doctor` to determine if your environment is properly configured for Android development, if not, resolve the issues which appear before continuing
2. In your terminal, run `flutter build apk --no-sound-null-safety`, this will build the Android app and will alert you of any build errors. If there are any build errors, those should be resolved before continuing as well
3. Start Android studio, open the android folder to import the project. If you are using Android Studio as your main development IDE then you'd want to change the view from `Android` to `Project` on the left hand project hierarchy tab
4. Select your development device (emulator or physical device) and then run the application from Android Studio.

### Getting Started on iOS

1. In your terminal, run `flutter doctor` to determine if your environment is properly configured for iOS development, if not, resolve the issues which appear before continuing
2. In your terminal, run `flutter build ios --no-sound-null-safety`, this will build the iOS app and will alert you of any build errors. If there are any build errors, those should be resolved before continuing as well
3. Open Xcode, once it launches you need to look up the `ios` directory and open the `Runner.xcworkspace` file. Xcode will then open the project, there will be no dart/swift/objective-c files in the project directory but that is fine
4. If you are developing using a simulator you can just choose a specific simulator and then run the application from XCode.

#### Using a physical iPhone for development

    If you want to develop on a physical device it's going to be a more involved process. It is highly recommended that you only attempt this on a Mac device as trying to emulate a Mac environment to run Xcode on Windows will be a very challenging task

5. Firstly, make sure you have an [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/). If you don't have one, you can use your Deakin email to sign up. You don't have to get the paid version, only the free account is necessary
6. Return to Xcode and go the `Accounts` settings and add in your Apple Developer account, once added you should be able to see at least your personal team listed (as well as any others your account is associated with)
7. Open the `Runner.xcodeproj` file from within the project hierarchy, select the `Runner` Target and then select the `Signings & Capabilities` tab, you should see the `Team` dropdown menu. Select the team you want to use for development. Xcode will now update the signing certificate for the app using your development profile
8. Almost done! Select your development device from the device selector and run the application. It will build and run but will stop immediately. On your iPhone, go to `Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management` and then select on the Developer App tab which corresponds to the email of your Apple Developer account. Press the 'Trust' button which appears at the top and then you will be good to go. Re-run the app from Xcode and it will launch properly

### NOTE  

At the moment we are using libraries which don't support Flutter Null Safety thus we must run the app differently than normal utilising an additional flag.  
`flutter run --[build configuration] --no-sound-null-safety` -> Runs on physical devices automatically if they are connected to your computer or running emulator.

## Setting up the backend

1. Clone the backend repository via `git clone https://github.com/redbackoperations/backend.git` and checkout the `extra-data-fields` branch
2. In your terminal, navigate to the repository directory and run `npm install` in the root of the project
3. You will need to ask the team lead for the credentials for the database. Once you have received them, create a new file in the root of the repository called `.env`. You need to copy and paste the key value pairs into this file.
4. Run `npm start` in the root of the project, this will start the server. Look for the "Web server is running in 8080..." message
5. Navigate back to this repo. In the `./collections` folder there is a postman collection file which you can import into postman. This collection file contains a few basic requests revolving Users, Signing Up and Signing In. The backend has a lot more endpoint than the ones provided by these are the most relevant for this project.
6. In the `./libs/Utils/constants.dart` file you will need to edit the server address based on which device you are developing for. Use 127.0.0.1 when testing with a browser and 10.0.2.2 when testing with the emulator or your IP Address if using a physical device

### NOTE

If you get an error while trying to run the GET User by ID request in postman and an error occurs, you will need to update the line in the `server.js` file in the backend repo remove an bit of code which is causing the error. Based on very basic testing, the code should look like this:

```
//find specific user with user ID or username
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
controller.FindUser(req, res)
})
```

## Logging into the app

You will be required to login when you enter the app. You may choose to create a new user right off the bat but if you do not want to then you can pass through with these credentials.

username: user  
password: user

## Working with MQTT to receive the sensor data during the workout

1. You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Inside that file you will to populate it with 3 environment variables; `MQTT_HOST`, `MQTT_USERNAME` and `MQTT_PASSWORD`. The IoT and Embedded Systems team will be able to direct you to these credentials. NOTE: These credentials should never be checked into version control systems
2. Afterwards you can just run the app as normal and if the workout services are online and running, you can just scan the QR code corresponding to the bike you want to use, start a workout then see the sensor data coming through. The QR codes can be found at the `./assets/QRCodes.pdf` directory  

Check out the `README` file in the `./lib/Workout` directory to learn more about the MQTT schema being used
